# Lip-Reading

## Abstract 
Automatic Visual Speech Recognition, or Automatic Lip Reading, is a way to understand the speech by interpreting lip movements automatically. In this work, we offer our lip-reading solution. We have proposed several architectures known to recognize 28 Arabic consonants and three vowels. An architecture that works on the geometric features alongside the SVM, and another that relies on the CNN and LSTM neural networks. And the results show that the accuracy of the proposed models is 92% for vowels, and 66% for consonants.
